# TF-Retinanet-Backbones-Resnet

Wrapper around Resnet implementation present in tf.keras, to make it compatible as backbone of
[tf-retinanet](https://github.com/fizyr/tf-retinanet "tf-retinanet").

This backbone is *not* the same used in [keras-retinanet](https://github.com/fizyr/keras-retinanet "keras-retinanet"),
so it *cannot* be used for porting networks from keras to tensorflow.

## Installation.
Install `tf-retinanet`:

```
git clone https://github.com/fizyr/tf-retinanet.git
cd tf-retinanet
python setup.py install --user
cd ..
```

Install `tf-retinanet-backbones-resnet50v2`:

```
git clone https://github.com/Jakedismo/tf-retinanet-backbones-resnet50v2.git
cd tf-retinanet-backbones-resnet
python setup.py install --user
cd ..
```
